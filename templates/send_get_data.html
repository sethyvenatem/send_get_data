<!-- Ideas:
	- Include help boxes with each field to explain what they mean
	- get goal temperatures and regulation schedule from data.

		This is my project to learn about web servers. There is a *.json file on my server at <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">pythonanywhere</a>. This page enables anyone to view the file content and add entries to it. The details on how it works are available in my Github repository.

		<h1> Content of the file </h1>

		<!--  Here a textbox and a button. When the button is pressed, the json file from the server is queried, red and it's content is displayed in the text box.--> 

		<input type="button" value="Get file content" onclick = "getFileContent()"> <br>
		<textarea id="fileContent" rows="4" cols="50" readonly></textarea>

		<h1> Modify the file </h1>

		<!-- Here an empty textbox and a button. When the button is pressed, the content of the textbox is appended to the json file in the server. Use the timestamp as a key for the json file.--> 

		<label>Type in something to add to the file:</label> <br> <textarea id="fileSubmit" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea> <br>
		<input type="button" value="Send data to file" onclick = "sendDataToFile()">
