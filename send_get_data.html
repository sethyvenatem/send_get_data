		<h1> Send and get data </h1>

		This is my project to learn about web servers. There is a *.json file on my server at <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">pythonanywhere</a>. This page enables anyone to view the file content and add entries to it. The details on how it works are available in my <a href="https://github.com/sethyvenatem/send_get_data">Github repository</a>.<br><br>

		You can send whatever you want to the file, but keep in mind that <b>it will be visible to anyone and you won't be able to remove it</b>.

		<h1> Content of the file </h1>

		<!--  Here a textbox and a button. When the button is pressed, the json file from the server is queried, red and it's content is displayed in the text box.--> 
		
		Click the button to view the content of the file: 
		<input type="button" value="Get file content" onclick = "getFileContent()"> <br>
		<textarea id="fileContent" rows="10" cols="100" readonly></textarea>

		<h1> Modify the file </h1>

		<!-- Here an empty textbox and a button. When the button is pressed, the content of the textbox is appended to the json file in the server. Use the timestamp as a key for the json file.--> 

		<label>Type in your name:</label> <br> <textarea id="name" rows="1" cols="50"></textarea> <br>
		<label>Type in some text to add to the file:</label> <br> <textarea id="fileSubmit" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea> <br>
		<input type="button" value="Send data to file" onclick = "sendDataToFile()">
